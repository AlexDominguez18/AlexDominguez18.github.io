# Alex's Duran Portfolio
---

Hi! If you're reading this, you're probably interested in learning more about me or exploring some features of this website. I based the main design on the open-source portfolio template by [@midudev](https://github.com/midudev/porfolio.dev).

I'm planning to update this repository over time and eventually change the design, but I needed to build something quickly because some recruiters asked for my web portfolio, and, well, I realized I didn't have one yet ðŸ˜….

That's all for now! If you want to check out the portfolio, just visit: [alexdominguez18.github.io](https://alexdominguez18.github.io) (and yes, I haven't paid for a custom domain yet).
